# Stormy - Secure password manager CLI

Stormy is a lightweight, secure, and user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) password manager written in Go. It uses bbolt for local storage and incorporates strong encryption to keep your passwords safe. With Stormy, you can manage your credentials directly from your terminal with speed and efficiency.

- **Local database**: Stormy uses the bbolt database for lightweight, local storage.
- **Salt for extra security**: Optionally add a salt to your master password for enhanced protection.
- **Command-line simplicity**: Add, retrieve, and manage your passwords entirely from the terminal.
